# comvision_pong
Classic pong game, but you control the paddle's position with the index finger. This computer vision project used @mediapipe library to detect hand landmarks, and game logic was written in javascript. Visuals were rendered with html5 canvas component.

(Styling is minimal. Hopefully I'll get to styling it when I have the time ðŸ¤­)
